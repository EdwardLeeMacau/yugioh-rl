Any player in this Mud can make his or her decks public to help other players.
deck public deckname can be used to make an own deck public. A public deck cannot be edited anymore.
deck private deckname however can make a deck private again, which allows it to be edited again.
deck publiclist will list all public decks in alphabetical order.

Public decks can be used by addressing them with the player name, followed by a slash and the deck name.
Example: toni/public-deck1

The command deck copy (see help deck) accepts a public deck path as source too, so you can create copies of other player's public decks and modify them to create a whole new deck.
Example: deck copy toni/public-deck1=my-really-cool-modification

Same goes for the deck view command, which allows you to take a look at a public deck's recipe.
